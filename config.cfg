# Skyscraper Configuration for Miyoo Mini
# =========================================
# This config file contains settings for scraping ROM artwork

# Base path to your ROM collection
# Example: /Volumes/SDCARD/Roms
ROM_BASE_PATH="$HOME/MIYOO/Roms"

# Path to store scraped cache/output
# Example: /Volumes/SDCARD/.skyscraper
CACHE_PATH="$HOME/MIYOO/cache"

# Artwork XML template file for generating custom artwork
# Point this to one of the artwork templates in the artwork/ folder
# Example: artwork/artwork-miyoo1.xml
ARTWORK_XML="artwork/artwork-miyoo1.xml"

# Scraping source - options: screenscraper, thegamesdb, openretro, igdb, mobygames, arcadedb
# screenscraper is recommended and most comprehensive
SCRAPE_SOURCE="screenscraper"

# ScreenScraper credentials (get free account at https://www.screenscraper.fr)
SCREENSCRAPER_USER=""
SCREENSCRAPER_PASS=""

# Artwork type - options: screenshot, cover, wheel, marquee, texture
# For Miyoo Mini, screenshot or cover usually works best
ARTWORK_TYPE="screenshot"

# Image dimensions for Miyoo Mini
# NOTE: These values are for reference only. Actual output dimensions should be
# configured in the artwork XML file (see artwork/*.xml for examples).
# The Skyscraper artwork XML <output> tag controls width and height.
IMAGE_WIDTH="640"
IMAGE_HEIGHT="480"

# Platforms to scrape - common Miyoo Mini platforms
# Each platform has a short name used by Skyscraper
# GB=gameboy, GBC=gbc, GBA=gba, NES=nes, SNES=snes, GENESIS/MD=megadrive, SMS=mastersystem
# PS1=psx, ARCADE=arcade, PCE=pcengine, NEOGEO=neogeo
PLATFORMS="gb gbc gba nes snes megadrive mastersystem psx arcade pcengine neogeo dos fds nds"

# Platform folder mappings - customize folder names for each platform
# Format: PLATFORM_FOLDER_<platform>="FolderName"
# This is useful for Onion OS which uses different folder names (e.g., FC for NES, SFC for SNES)
# If not set, scripts will try the platform name (lowercase) and then uppercase
# Examples for Onion OS:
# PLATFORM_FOLDER_nes="FC"
# PLATFORM_FOLDER_snes="SFC"
# PLATFORM_FOLDER_gb="GB"
# PLATFORM_FOLDER_gbc="GBC"
# PLATFORM_FOLDER_gba="GBA"
# PLATFORM_FOLDER_megadrive="MD"
# PLATFORM_FOLDER_mastersystem="MS"
# PLATFORM_FOLDER_psx="PS"
# PLATFORM_FOLDER_pcengine="PCE"
# PLATFORM_FOLDER_neogeo="NEOGEO"
# PLATFORM_FOLDER_arcade="ARCADE"

# Uncomment and customize the mappings below for your setup:
PLATFORM_FOLDER_gb="GB"
PLATFORM_FOLDER_gbc="GBC"
PLATFORM_FOLDER_gba="GBA"
PLATFORM_FOLDER_nds="NDS"
PLATFORM_FOLDER_nes="FC"
